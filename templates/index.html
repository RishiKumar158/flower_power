  <h2>About Flower Power</h2>
  <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center">
    Did you know flowers are scientifically proven to provide a moment of calm?
    Research from the University of North Florida‚Äôs Department of Public Health shows that living with flowers significantly reduces our stress.
    That is good news considering 68 percent of people report experiencing stress weekly and 32 percent feel stress daily.
    A simple solution to help relieve your stress is to have flowers on your nightstand to see when you first wake up,
    on your desk to provide a breath of fresh air while you work, or on your kitchen counter or coffee table to help you unwind after a hectic day.
    Flowers do wonders for your well-being, increasing happiness, workplace productivity, decreasing worry and anxiety, and more.

  <h2>Dashboard</h2>
  <p>This dashboard is done using a software called PowerBI which is a product of Microsoft.
        Here I have just attached the images of the dashboard because PowerBI needs oraganizational
        account. So to see the visualizations interactive I am attaching my <a href="../static/flower_power.pbix" style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">PowerBI</a>
        dashboard file. This requires PowerBI software to open the file. The usage of dashboards like
        these is to bring a better understanding about the dataset and also to bring some beautiful insights</p>
